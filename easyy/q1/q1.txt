“The Vanishing Scrolls”

In the ancient library of Numaria, a wise scribe named Oren was tasked with preserving a series of magical scrolls. These scrolls were uniquely numbered and stored in strictly increasing order, starting from 1 and going infinitely.

However, during a raid by shadow bandits, some scrolls mysteriously vanished from the archive. Oren managed to record the scrolls that remained, but now he needs your help.

He provides you with a list of scroll numbers that survived the attack — all of them in increasing order and without duplicates. He also gives you a number k, and asks:

"What is the number of the kth scroll that was stolen?"

Your task is to retrieve this number for Oren before the High Council realizes what’s missing.



Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
1 <= k <= 1000
arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length
