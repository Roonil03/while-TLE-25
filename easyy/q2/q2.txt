Whispers of the Stone Oracle

In the ancient realm of Etherya, the Stone Oracle speaks only in riddles — cryptic sequences of digits carved into enchanted tablets. Each digit from 2 to 9 holds the power to invoke one of several arcane runes, and each rune has a unique letter-shaped symbol.

Only the most skilled scribes can decipher the true messages behind these sequences, by unfolding every possible way the Oracle’s digits might translate into letters.

The monks of the High Tower present to you a sacred sequence of digits. Your task is to reveal all possible incantations the Oracle may have encoded in that sequence — each a combination of rune-symbols corresponding to the digits, in order.


Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
Example 2:

Input: digits = ""
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
 

Constraints:

0 <= digits.length <= 4
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].
