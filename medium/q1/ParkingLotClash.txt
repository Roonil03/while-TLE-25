Parking Lot Clash

In a narrow one-way alley, cars are trying to enter from both ends.
Positive integers represent cars entering from the east end, moving westward.
Negative integers represent cars entering from the west end, moving eastward.
The absolute value of each number represents the size (or aggressiveness) of the car.
When two cars meet head-on:
The smaller car backs off and leaves the alley.
If both cars are the same size, they both reverse out and leave.
Cars traveling in the same direction never interact.
Simulate the sequence of events and determine which cars remain in the alley after all conflicts have resolved.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t — the number of test cases.
For each test case:
The first line contains an integer n — the number of cars entering the alley.
The second line contains n space-separated integers — the list of cars, in the order they enter.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the space-separated list of remaining cars in the alley, in order.

Example Input

Constraints

1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
2 ≤ n ≤ 10000
-1000 ≤ car[i] ≤ 1000

0 is not a valid input (no stationary cars)
