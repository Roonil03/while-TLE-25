Drift Racing Clash

You're observing several simulations of a drifting competition on a straight track. In each simulation, a number of cars line up. Every car is represented by an integer:

The sign of the number indicates the direction the car is moving:
Positive for right, negative for left.
The absolute value represents the car’s power.
All cars move at the same speed. When two cars meet:
The weaker one gets knocked off the track.
If both have equal power, both are removed.
Cars moving in the same direction never collide.
Determine the final order of the cars after all possible collisions.

Input
The first line contains an integer t, the number of test cases.
For each test case:
The first line contains an integer n — the number of cars in the simulation.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the lineup of cars.

Output
For each test case, print a line of space-separated integers representing the final state of cars on the track after all clashes are resolved. If no cars remain, print an empty line.
